# LiveCode.plist


**Attribution:* 2014-11-25: History: This plist was adapted from the LiveScript.plist (a completely different language use as a kind of "IDE" for Javascript) by Ben Rubinstein. Brahmanathaswami added some folding features. He also set this up as a separate public repository.

**CAVEATS** 

1. This is working on Brahmanathaswami's machine running BBedit 11 under Yosemite.
2. The Language Feature section at the bottom is being implemented for commands and functions which will fold properly, but IF and Switch  do not fold.
3. Note that went fold a node the "end ###" part of the command disappears also into the fold
